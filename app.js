// three constructs - approach/ snytaxes for managing control flow

// sequencing - when the browser execute the code in our js file, it reads the file through the file, top to bottom, then run from top to bottom
// Looping: The code in the loop repeatedly executes while a condition is truthy (run code for number of times [n])
// Branching: Different code paths are executed based on a conditional expression (either or / if else statments)
